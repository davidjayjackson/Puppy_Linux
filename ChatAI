###Here is an example of how you could use the awk command to count the number of cases per day in a file called "data.txt":
Explanation:

{count[$1]++}: The script will create an associative array called "count" and increment the value of the first field (date) each time it appears in the file.
END {for (date in count) print date, count[date]}: After all lines have been read, the script will iterate through the "count" array and print the date and number of occurrences for each date.
Note: This is just a general example, you might have to adjust your command based on the format of your data.

gawk -F"," 'BEGIN{OFS=","}{count[$1]++} END {for (date in count) print date, count[date]}' covid.csv

#### The file contains two columns date and number of cases for that day:

* Explanation:

{count[$1] += $2}: The script will create an associative array called "count" and add the value of the second field (number of cases) to the value of the first field (date) each time it appears in the file.
END {for (date in count) print date, count[date]}: After all lines have been read, the script will iterate through the "count" array and print the date and number of occurrences for each date.
Note: This is just a general example, you might have to adjust your command based on the format of your data.

awk -F"," 'BEGIN{OFS=","}{count[$2] += $6} END {for (date in count) print date, count[date]}' covid.csv |head

### bash shell script to insert csv data into sqlite database
This script assumes that the first line of the CSV file contains the column headers and that the data types of the columns match the types specified in the "CREATE TABLE" statement. 
Also, this script will insert data in the table named 'data' if table is not present it will create table first.

#!/bin/bash

# specify the CSV file and SQLite database
csv_file=path/to/data.csv
db_file=path/to/database.db

# create the table if it does not exist
sqlite3 $db_file "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS data (col1 INTEGER, col2 TEXT, col3 REAL);"

# import the data from the CSV file into the table
sqlite3 -separator , $db_file ".import $csv_file data"

#### Puppy linux  how do I configure GDM?

To configure GDM (GNOME Display Manager) in Puppy Linux, you will need to edit the GDM configuration file located at /etc/gdm/custom.conf . 
This file contains various options that can be used to customize the behavior of GDM.
You can open the file in a text editor by running the command 'sudo nano /etc/gdm/custom.conf'.
Once you have made your changes, save the file and then restart GDM by 

RUNNNIG 'sudo service gdm restart' or 'sudo systemctl restart gdm' in the terminal.
Please be careful when making changes to system configuration files, as incorrect changes may cause issues with your system.

#### Bash script to pull data from sqlite database?

#!/bin/bash

# Assign the results of a query to a variable
results=$(sqlite3 database.db "SELECT * FROM table;")

# Print the results
echo "$results"

sqlite3 -header -csv database.db "SELECT * FROM table;" > output.csv

#### write a gawk script that calculates the covid case by country and date?

#!/usr/bin/gawk -f

BEGIN {
    FS="," # set the field separator to a comma
    OFS="," # set the output field separator to a comma
    print "Country,Date,Cases" # print the header row
}

# Keep a count of the cases for each country and date
{
    cases[$1][$2] += $3
}

END {
    # iterate over the countries and dates
    for (country in cases) {
        for (date in cases[country]) {
            # print the country, date, and case count
            print country, date, cases[country][date]
        }
    }
}

#### How can I have different windows managers for different users in Puppy Linux

In Puppy Linux, you can use the "xwin" command to start a specific window manager for a specific user.
For example, to start JWM (Joe's Window Manager) for user "puppy", you would use the command "xwin jwm -user puppy". 
To start another window manager, such as Openbox, for another user "dog", you would use the command "xwin openbox -user dog". 
You can also set a default window manager in the file /etc/X11/xinitrc for new users.

#### Xmonad how do I change the font size for the terminal?
* Look for the config file:
~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs directory). 
* Look for the section where the terminal emulator is defined

* xmonad --recompile && xmonad --restart

#### In i3 how do I change the font size in the terminal?
Look for the section where the terminal emulator is defined, which is usually called "bindsym".
* Add the following line to set the font size: font pango:monospace 12
* Restart i3 for the changes to take effect: i3-msg restart
