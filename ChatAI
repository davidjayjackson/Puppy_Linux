Here is an example of how you could use the awk command to count the number of cases per day in a file called "data.txt":
Explanation:

{count[$1]++}: The script will create an associative array called "count" and increment the value of the first field (date) each time it appears in the file.
END {for (date in count) print date, count[date]}: After all lines have been read, the script will iterate through the "count" array and print the date and number of occurrences for each date.
Note: This is just a general example, you might have to adjust your command based on the format of your data.

awk '{count[$1]++} END {for (date in count) print date, count[date]}' data.txt

The file contains two columns date and number of cases for that day:

Explanation:

{count[$1] += $2}: The script will create an associative array called "count" and add the value of the second field (number of cases) to the value of the first field (date) each time it appears in the file.
END {for (date in count) print date, count[date]}: After all lines have been read, the script will iterate through the "count" array and print the date and number of occurrences for each date.
Note: This is just a general example, you might have to adjust your command based on the format of your data.

awk '{count[$1] += $2} END {for (date in count) print date, count[date]}' data.txt
