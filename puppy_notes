#### (1) One question is how do I enable cut-and-paste to and from the Urxvt terminal?

```

Copy- left click hold and highlight

Paste- middle button click

Also works to copy from terminal and paste to other programs.

Also if you use copy method that comes with other programs you can paste in terminal by middle mouse button click.

If you do not have a middle mouse button.

Clicking the left and right buttons, at the same time, will have same effect as middle mouse button.

shift+insert will also work to paste.

Note:
copy stuff is stored in the clipboard.
The last thing copied is what is pasted.
You can click on the clipboard manager icon on the right side of the desktop tray.
It will have a list of all items copied, during this session of Puppy operation.
You can select one of them from this list.
That will now be what is pasted.

```
