#### (1) One question is how do I enable cut-and-paste to and from the Urxvt terminal?

```
@ Wizard, You will find good instructions here: https://forum.puppylinux.com/viewtopic.php?t=5750

@BigPup, Copy- left click hold and highlight

Paste- middle button click

Also works to copy from terminal and paste to other programs.

Also if you use copy method that comes with other programs you can paste in terminal by middle mouse button click.

If you do not have a middle mouse button.

Clicking the left and right buttons, at the same time, will have same effect as middle mouse button.

shift+insert will also work to paste.

Note:
copy stuff is stored in the clipboard.
The last thing copied is what is pasted.
You can click on the clipboard manager icon on the right side of the desktop tray.
It will have a list of all items copied, during this session of Puppy operation.
You can select one of them from this list.
That will now be what is pasted.
-----
(1A) If you want to cut something so it is no longer at a specific place in whatever is displayed.
You want to now place it in a different location.

This is a basic terminal.

What I do is copy what it is I want to cut.
Paste it to new location.
Go back to original and delete it.

Someone may know a different way, but I have found that gives me a good backup of the original, till I am sure I want to delete it from where it was.
Plus make sure it pasted correctly to where I wanted it.

============ LX Terminal ====================
(1B) mikeslr , As my fingers are not all that agile, I install *LxTerminal* if it's not already present. I then use Menu>Setup>Default Application Chooser to set LxTerminal as the default terminal.
LxTerminal's Menu bar provides Edit>Copy Edit>paste, used in conjunction with high-lighting as under geany/text-editors, and will copy/paste to and from those.
That almost works completely. LxTerminal will open from menus and launchers, and if I Right-Click an empty space and select Window>terminal here. But if I Right-Click a script or executable and select 'Run in terminal' some other terminal opens.
There's probably a way to fix that, But I only use 'Run in terminal' when trying to find out if something will run at all, or obtain a terminal display of what's going wrong if it doesn't.
